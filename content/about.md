title: "About Me"
---

I am currently a 5th year PhD student in the [Harvard
Biostatistics](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/) department. I'm
advised by [Xihong Lin](https://content.sph.harvard.edu/xlin/) and my research
is on statistical genetics and COVID-19 epidemiology and modeling. I also work
closely with [Rajarshi Mukherjee](https://scholar.harvard.edu/rajarshi/home).

In 2016, I graduated from Harvard College with a BA in
[statistics](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/) and MS in [computational
science and
engineering (CSE)](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/applied-computation/graduate-programs/masters-computational-science-and-engineering).
