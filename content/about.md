I am currently a 5th year PhD student in the
[Harvard Biostatistics](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/)
department. I'm advised by [Xihong Lin](https://content.sph.harvard.edu/xlin/)
and my research is on statistical genetics and COVID-19 epidemiology and
modeling.

Previously, I obtained a BA/MS in statistics and computational science and
engineering from Harvard.
