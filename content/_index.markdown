Welcome to my site! I'm currently a 5th year PhD student in the 
[Harvard Biostatistics](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/) department,
and I'm advised by [Xihong Lin](https://content.sph.harvard.edu/xlin/).

Here I'll post tutorials, code examples, etc. that have come up in my
research or my work. You can find all the posts below.
