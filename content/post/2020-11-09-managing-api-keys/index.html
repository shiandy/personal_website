<p>In this post, I’ll address how I like to store and use my API keys.</p>
<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>When using computer software to access secured resources or services, typically
over the internet, the software usually requires an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface_key">API
key</a>. The
API key is like a password the software to authenticate itself to the resource
or service. As an example, I’m a TA for a data science class where we use Github
to manage students’ homework assignments. For each homework assignment, each
student gets their own private repository that only they and the course staff
can see. In order to create and push those repositories, the script I use,
<a href="https://github.com/education/teachers_pet">Teacher’s pet</a> needs to authenticate
itself to Github, and the way it does so is via an API key.</p>

<h1>Bad ways to store API Keys</h1>
<p>Technically, API keys should be treated like passwords, because if someone has
your API key, they could potentially perform operations without your permission.
In the case of the data science TA example, an unauthorized user could delete
all the students’ homework repositories. Here are some downsides of some common
ways API keys are stored:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Environment variables: The drawback of this approach is that
environment variables are visible to every program on your computer, and a
malicious program could publicize these. Additionally, people sometimes
initialize these environment variables in their <code>bashrc</code> file, which is an
unencrypted file—if you wouldn’t store your password in an unencrypted file,
why store your API key that way?</p></li>
<li><p>Directly within your code: This is a big no-no, especially if you’re going to
push your code to a public Github repository. If you accidentally push your
API key, you’ll need to fully delete it from your history using something like
<a href="https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/">bfg</a>, or other people will be
able to see it.</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="using-a-password-manager-for-api-keys" class="section level1">
<h1>Using a password manager for API Keys</h1>
<p>A lot of programs allow you to pass in the API key as a command line argument.
If you’re writing your own program that requires an API key, make it take the
API key as a command line argument instead of hard coding it in—this makes it
harder for you to accidentally push the API key to Github. (NB: To parse command
line arguments, you can use the
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=optparse">optparse</a> for R and
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html">argparse</a> for Python).
Therefore, you can store your API key in a password manager and copy/paste it
when you call your program. The password manager will encrypt the API key so
it’s more secure than storing it in an unencrypted file or your <code>bashrc</code>.
Additionally, if you’re worried about your bash history being saved (in a
plaintext file no less), you can prevent certain entries from being recorded.
<a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/6094/is-there-any-way-to-keep-a-command-from-being-added-to-your-history">This Stackoverflow
post</a>
has solutions for both <code>bash</code> and <code>zsh</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, if you can interface with your password manager on the command line,
you can forgo the copy/paste step by passing the output of the password
decryption step as a command line argument, using <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Command-Substitution.html">command
substitution</a>.
Here’s an example using the <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">pass password
manager</a>:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>my_command --apikey=$(pass show api_key/Github)</code></pre>
